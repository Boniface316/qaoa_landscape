# Connecting the Hamiltonian structure to the QAOA energy and Fourier landscape structure

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the results presented in the paper titled "Connecting the Hamiltonian structure to the QAOA energy and Fourier landscape structure." The paper is available on arXiv: [arXiv:2305.13594](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13594).

## Installing the required packages and runing the experiments

Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal:

`bash pip install -r requirements.txt`

To reproduce the results presented in the paper, run the python script in `paper_plots`. Below is an example of how to run the script for Figure 1:

`bash python paper_plots/figure_1/main.py`

The results will be saved to `results` folder. They will include hamiltonian, plot data and plots.

For any further details or inquiries, please refer to the paper or contact the authors directly.

We hope you find this repository useful and that it helps in understanding the Hamiltonian structure in relation to the QAOA energy and Fourier landscape structure.
